## ðŸ’¡ About the project

ðŸš€ Minishell is the fruit of a collaboration between two students at Ecole 42 in Paris. In this project, we aimed to create a simple shell, which provided us with valuable hands-on experience in processes and file descriptors. Our task involved building a fully functional shell with features such as prompt display, command history, redirections, and pipes. We also learned how to interpret environment variables and implement built-in commands.

## ðŸ”¦ Skills
* Rigor
* Unix
* Imperative programming

## ðŸ”Œ Built-ins Implemented
- `echo`: Supports the `-n` option.
- `cd`: Allows for changing the current working directory using relative or absolute paths.
- `pwd`: Displays the current working directory.
- `export`: Manages environment variables without any options.
- `unset`: Removes environment variables without any options.
- `env`: Displays the environment variables or arguments.
- `exit`: Exits the shell without any options.
